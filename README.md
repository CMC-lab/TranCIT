Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) is a Python package for quantifying causal relationships in multivariate time series data. It provides methods for analyzing directional influences using model-based statistical tools, inspired by information-theoretic and autoregressive frameworks.

## Features

- Estimate dynamic causal strength (DCS)
- VAR-based modeling of time series data
- Event-based snapshot extraction
- BIC-based model order selection
- Statistical analysis of event structures
- Modular and extensible pipeline

## Installation

```bash
  pip install dynamic-causal-strength
```

## Quickstart

```python
from dcs import compute_causal_strength

# Example usage
results = compute_causal_strength(data, config)
```
