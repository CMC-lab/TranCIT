Contributions to the Dynamic Causal Strength package are welcome! Whether it's reporting bugs, suggesting features, improving documentation, or submitting code changes, your help is appreciated.

Reporting Issues
================

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please check the `GitHub Issues <URL_TO_YOUR_GITHUB_ISSUES>`_ page to see if a similar issue already exists. If not, feel free to open a new issue, providing as much detail as possible:

* Describe the expected behavior.
* Describe the actual behavior or the bug.
* Provide steps to reproduce the issue, including code snippets or sample data if possible.
* Mention your operating system, Python version, and the versions of relevant libraries (`dcs`, `numpy`, `scipy`).

Feature Requests
================

We are open to suggestions for new features or enhancements. Please open a GitHub issue describing the proposed feature and its potential use case.

Contributing Code
=================

If you would like to contribute code changes (e.g., bug fixes, new features):

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix (`git checkout -b your-feature-name`).
3. **Make your changes.** Please ensure your code follows the existing style (PEP 8, checked with `flake8` and `black`) and includes relevant docstrings.
4. **Add unit tests** for any new functionality or bug fixes. Ensure all tests pass by running `pytest` in the project root directory.
5. **Update documentation** (docstrings, `.rst` files) if your changes affect the API or usage.
6. **Commit your changes** with clear and descriptive commit messages.
7. **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub (`git push origin your-feature-name`).
8. **Open a Pull Request** against the main branch of the original repository. Provide a clear description of your changes in the pull request.

*(Note: This section could also just reference your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file if you prefer to maintain guidelines there [cite: uploaded:dynamic-causal-strength/README.md]. You could replace the text above with: Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md <URL_TO_CONTRIBUTING.MD>`_ file in the repository for detailed contribution guidelines.)*
