===========================
Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS)
===========================

**Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS)** is a Python package for detecting and analyzing causal relationships in time series data.
It provides tools for model estimation, causality detection, and simulation, with a focus on dynamic, non-stationary systems.

Source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/CMC-lab/dcs>`_.
You can find examples in the `examples/` folder of the repository to help you get started quickly.

What is DCS?
============

DCS is designed for researchers and scientists working with complex temporal signals such as neural recordings or economic indicators.
It focuses on detecting event-based and dynamic causal interactions in systems where traditional stationary assumptions may not hold.

Key features:
- Estimation of dynamic causal effects using robust statistical tools
- Simulation of synthetic causal systems for benchmarking
- Integrated preprocessing and event window extraction utilities
- Ready-to-use pipelines for real-world data
