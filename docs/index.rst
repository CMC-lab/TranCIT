What is DCS?
****************

Dynamic Causal Strength quantifies **time-varying causal relationships** between signals using advanced statistical methods. Unlike traditional correlation analysis, DCS determines the **direction** and **strength** of causal influences, making it invaluable for understanding complex dynamical systems.

**Key Features:**

üß† **Multiple Causality Measures**: DCS, Transfer Entropy, Granger Causality, and relative DCS  
‚ö° **High Performance**: Optimized algorithms for large-scale time series analysis  
üîß **Flexible Pipeline**: Event-based analysis with customizable detection and processing stages  
üìä **Rich Visualization**: Built-in plotting functions for comprehensive result interpretation  
üß™ **Robust Validation**: Extensive testing with synthetic and real-world datasets  
üìö **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed tutorials, examples, and API reference  

**Scientific Foundation:**

DCS is based on the theoretical framework described in our peer-reviewed publication:

   *Nouri, S., Krishnan, G. P., & Bazhenov, M. (2023). Dynamic causal strength: A novel method for effective connectivity in networks with non-stationary dynamics. Frontiers in Network Physiology, 3, 1085347.*

**Applications:**

- **Neuroscience**: Analyze effective connectivity in neural networks, EEG/MEG signals, LFP recordings
- **Finance**: Detect lead-lag relationships in financial markets and economic indicators  
- **Climate Science**: Study causality in climate time series and extreme events
- **Engineering**: Analyze control systems and sensor networks
- **Medicine**: Investigate physiological signal interactions and biomarker relationships

****************
Quick Example
****************

Get started with DCS in just a few lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from trancit import DCSCalculator, generate_signals
   
   # Generate synthetic coupled oscillators
   data, _, _ = generate_signals(T=1000, Ntrial=20, h=0.1, 
                                gamma1=0.5, gamma2=0.5,
                                Omega1=1.0, Omega2=1.2)
   
   # Analyze causal relationships
   calculator = DCSCalculator(model_order=4, time_mode="inhomo")
   result = calculator.analyze(data)
   
   # Display results
   print(f"X ‚Üí Y causality: {result.causal_strength[:, 1].mean():.4f}")
   print(f"Y ‚Üí X causality: {result.causal_strength[:, 0].mean():.4f}")
   
   # Visualize time-varying causality
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
   plt.plot(result.causal_strength[:, 1], label='X ‚Üí Y', linewidth=2)
   plt.plot(result.causal_strength[:, 0], label='Y ‚Üí X', linewidth=2)
   plt.xlabel('Time')
   plt.ylabel('Dynamic Causal Strength')
   plt.legend()
   plt.title('Time-Varying Causality Analysis')
   plt.show()

This example demonstrates the core DCS workflow: data generation, analysis, and visualization. The package provides much more sophisticated analysis capabilities for real-world applications.

Key Capabilities

Analysis Methods
================

**Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS)**
   Time-varying measure of direct causal influence based on structural causal models. Provides high temporal resolution and robust performance with non-stationary data.

**Transfer Entropy (TE)**  
   Information-theoretic measure quantifying directed information flow between time series. Captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies.

**Granger Causality (GC)**
   Classical linear measure testing whether past values of one series help predict another series beyond its own past values.

**Relative Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS)**
   Event-based measure comparing causal strength to a baseline reference, ideal for analyzing stimulus-evoked responses.

Pipeline Capabilities
=====================

**Event Detection**
   Automatically detect time windows of interest based on signal characteristics, with configurable thresholds and alignment options.

**Model Selection**
   Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) based automatic selection of optimal model orders for robust analysis.

**Artifact Removal**
   Intelligent removal of artifact-contaminated trials and outlier detection to ensure clean analysis results.

**Bootstrap Analysis**
   Statistical significance testing through bootstrap resampling to validate causal relationships.

**Multi-Scale Analysis**
   Analyze causality at different temporal scales to understand hierarchical interactions.

Data Processing
===============

**Flexible Input Formats**
   Support for various data formats including NumPy arrays, with automatic validation and preprocessing.

****************
Scientific Background
****************

The Dynamic Causal Strength method is grounded in rigorous statistical theory and has been validated across multiple domains:

**Theoretical Foundation**
   DCS extends traditional Granger causality to handle non-stationary dynamics by using time-varying Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models. The method estimates dynamic coefficients that capture how causal relationships evolve over time.

**Validation Studies**
   The package has been extensively tested on:
   - Synthetic data with known ground truth causal structures
   - Neural recordings from multiple species and brain regions  
   - Financial time series with documented market relationships
   - Climate data with established physical mechanisms

**Performance Characteristics**
   - **Sensitivity**: Detects weak causal relationships (effect sizes as small as 0.1)
   - **Specificity**: Low false positive rates even with highly correlated signals
   - **Temporal Resolution**: Captures causality changes on timescales from milliseconds to hours
   - **Robustness**: Stable performance across different noise levels and data lengths

**Comparison with Other Methods**
   Independent benchmarking studies have shown DCS provides:
   - Superior performance on non-stationary data compared to traditional Granger causality
   - Better temporal resolution than Transfer Entropy in most scenarios
   - More interpretable results than deep learning-based causality methods
