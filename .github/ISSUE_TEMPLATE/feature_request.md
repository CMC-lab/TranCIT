## Feature Description

A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see added.

## Scientific Motivation

**What scientific problem would this solve?**

- [ ] New causality analysis method
- [ ] Performance improvement for large datasets
- [ ] Support for new data types (EEG, fMRI, etc.)
- [ ] Statistical validation features
- [ ] Visualization enhancements
- [ ] Pipeline automation
- [ ] Other: ________________

## Research Context

- **Field of application**: [e.g., neuroscience, finance, climate science]
- **Data characteristics**: [e.g., high-frequency, multivariate, non-stationary]
- **Analysis requirements**: [e.g., real-time, large-scale, statistical significance]

## Proposed Solution

**Describe the feature you'd like:**
A clear description of what you want to happen.

```python
# Example of how you envision using this feature
from trancit import NewFeature

# Pseudo-code showing the desired API
result = NewFeature(parameters).analyze(data)
```
